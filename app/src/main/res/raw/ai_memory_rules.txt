When to save AI memory (guidelines):

USE TEMPORARY MEMORY (with duration in minutes) for:
- Temporary situations: "working temporarily", "on vacation", "sick today", "guest at home"
- Current context: "currently focused on X", "taking a break", "in a meeting"
- Short-term plans: "deadline this week", "project due Friday"
- Time-bound goals: "trying to avoid X today", "focusing on Y this afternoon"

USE PERMANENT MEMORY (no duration) for:
- Persistent preferences: "prefers working in morning", "doesn't like interruptions"
- Long-term goals: "wants to learn programming", "building a business"
- User characteristics: "works from home", "has kids", "studies at night"
- Lasting constraints: "can't use phone at work", "meditation every morning"

IMPORTANT: If the content mentions "temporarily", "currently", "today", "this week" → USE TEMPORARY with appropriate duration!
Example: "User working for Google temporarily" → remember("...", 10080) [7 days in minutes]

Format for remember(content, minutes?):
- Permanent: remember("<content>")
- Temporary: remember("<content>", <minutes>)
