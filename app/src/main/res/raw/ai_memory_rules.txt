When to save AI memory (guidelines):
- Save user preferences that matter across sessions (e.g., goals, constraints).
- Save temporary context only if it helps the next session; set a duration.
- Avoid saving redundant/obvious facts or volatile data.
- Keep each memory concise and factual, one idea per line.

Format for remember(content, minutes?):
- Permanent: remember("<content>")
- Temporary: remember("<content>", <minutes>)
